This application requires Node.js, Express.js, and Sequilize. In order to connect to the database, the user must run `mysql -u root -p` then enter their password from the '.env' file. 
Once the user has entered their MySQL username and password, the user must source the 'schema.sql' file. Once the 'schema.sql' file has been sourced, to seed this file, run `npm run seed`.
